1) Fix the jQuery problem with the 'slideToggle' function on the 'js--main-navigation' class
   The problem: when you click on the button, and it rolls the navigation upwards - if you increase the size of the screen again, the nav will be still hidden because it went upwards and you never clicked on it again so it could come back. 

2) After the layout is designed with flexbox and grid, create a hover effect on the price boxes: when the mouse's on it, the box gets bigger.
